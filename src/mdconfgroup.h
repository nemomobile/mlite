/*!
    \brief The MDConfGroup class provides access to a group of properties stored by DConf.

    An instance of MDConfGroup provides accessors for properties relative to
    its \l path() and \l scope().

    The \l value() and \l setValue() functions provide a means of reading and
    writing QVariant values for a relative key where the following types are
    supported:

    \list
    \li bool, int, double, and other basic numeric types.
    \li QString
    \li QByteArray
    \li QStringList
    \li QVariantList
    \li QVariantMap

    The following types are also supported if a type hint is provided to  \l value():

    \list
    \li QPoint
    \li QPointF
    \li QSize
    \li QSizeF
    \li QRect
    \li QRectF
    \endlist

    It is also possible to inherit from MDConfGroup and bind the properties
    of the derived type to values stored in DConf.  This provides a means to
    initialize properties with values read from DConf and update those
    properties automatically when they are changed remotely.  If they are
    changed locally then those changes will also be written back to DConf.

    To enable this feature pass the BindProperties option to the constructor
    and call the \l resolveMetaObject() function when the Qt meta-object is
    complete.  Normally this is would be in the constructor of the derived type
    but types with dynamic meta-objects should defer this call until they are
    constructed.
